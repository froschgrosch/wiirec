# WiiRec

Two powershell helper scripts to record Wii Gameplay.

A detailed rundown of how this came about can be read on my blog, but in short this collection of scripts allows you to record Wii Gameplay with a cheap HDMI to USB converter.
It uses ffmpeg to do the actual work, the script only figures out filenames and output folders.
